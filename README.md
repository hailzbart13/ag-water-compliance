# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains weekly Python projects and assignments that document my progress as I learn programming and explore new technical skills.

Each project focuses on applying Python to real-world problems — from data handling and automation to small web experiments — helping me build both confidence and creativity as I grow.

## About This Project

I am currently studying Python through the **Python for Everybody** course and creating self-directed assignments to reinforce what I learn each week.

The goal of this repository is twofold:

- **Build a strong foundation in programming** through consistent, hands-on practice.  
- **Develop a portfolio** that reflects my transition into a tech-focused career centered around data, problem-solving, and automation.

This repo is organized by week.
