# Agricultural Economics + Python Homework

This repository contains weekly Python assignments that combine 
programming practice with **Agricultural Economics** and 
**Sustainability** concepts.  

Each week introduces a small project where Python skills are applied to 
real-world agricultural problems — building both technical and economic insight.
# Agricultural Economics + Python Homework

I am currently learning **Python** through the [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) course while also studying **sustainability and agricultural economics**.  

This repository documents my weekly assignments that I make for myself where I apply new Python concepts to problems in **agricultural economics**.  

The goal of this project is twofold:  
- Build a strong foundation in programming.  
- Create a portfolio that connects data analysis and sustainability to 
  real-world agricultural issues — supporting my path toward a career in **Agricultural Economics**.
