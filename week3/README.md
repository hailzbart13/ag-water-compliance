# Week 3: Web Scraper for Image Extraction

This assignment explores **web scraping** using Python’s `urllib` and the `BeautifulSoup` library.  
The goal is to retrieve and list all image sources from a real webpage — in this case, an article on [GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive).

## Why this matters
Web scraping is a fundamental skill for data collection, automation, and research.  
Being able to extract information such as images, text, or links from web pages helps developers build datasets, analyze content trends, and understand how websites structure information.

## Example Input
Target webpage: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/are-video-games-really-more-expensive
